### Installation

#### Requirements
* C++17 compatible compiler
* _(Optional)_ Google Test for tests (included as submodule)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/foxcpp/wire
$ cd wire
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ cmake --build .
```

**Note 1** By default libwire will be built as a static library, if you want
a shared library then you should add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS` flag.

### Usage

#### Build system configuration

If you use CMake and clone libwire as a submodule, you can just link it this way:
```cmake
add_subdirectory(wire/)
target_link_library(your-exectuable libwire)
```
It will use CMake magic to configure include path and other stuff.

Alternatively, you can access system-installed version using `Findlibwire` module.
```cmake
find_package(libwire REQUIRED)
target_link_library(your-executable libwire)
```

##### Other build system

You should try CMake sometime. It's a good thing! However, there is no integration for other build systems.


#### In code

Let's write a simple TCP server that echoes back `\n`-terminated strings.

First, include TCP server header:
```cpp
#include <libwire/tcp_server.hpp>
```

Then... It's very short so it doesn't needs any commentary:
```cpp
tcp_server server{7};

while (true) {
    auto connection = server.wait_for_connection();
    auto str = connection.read_until<std::string>('\n');
    connection.write(str);
}
```


### Examples

See [examples/](examples/) directory for sources and [documentation](https://foxcpp.github.io/wire) for detailed description.


### Documentation

Maintained in Markdown format (for separate page) and as a docstrings in code (for reference).
Documentation for lastest commit in master is availiable [here](https://foxcpp.github.io/wire).
You can also build it locally by running `make doc`. Ouput will be placed in `docs/` directory.

**Note** Undocumented public function which behavior is not obvious is A BUG. Report it!

### Contributing

Here is some of the ways that you can contribute:
* Submit a bug report. We love hearing about broken things, so that we can fix them.
* Provide feedback. Even simple questions about how things work or why they were done a certain way carries value.
* Test code. Checkout `dev` branch, compile it and start trying to break stuff! :-)
* Write code. Check issues marked with [**help wanted**](https://github.com/foxcpp/wire/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tag.

See [CODE_STYLE.md](CODE_STYLE.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
Use [Uncrustify](http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net/) for auto-formatting.
(there is no configuration file for it yet, sorry, but it's not possible to configure different formatters for 100% match with our codestyle)
